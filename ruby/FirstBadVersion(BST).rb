# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 5, bad = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
# Then 4 is the first bad version.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, bad = 1
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

# The is_bad_version API is already defined for you.
# @param {Integer} version
# @return {boolean} whether the version is bad
# def is_bad_version(version):

# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Integer}
def first_bad_version(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  l = 0
  r = n
  while l <= r
    mid = (r-l)/2 + l
    if is_bad_version(mid)
      r = mid
    else 
      l = mid
    end
    return r if l + 1 >= r
  end
end
