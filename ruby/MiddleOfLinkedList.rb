# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: [4,5,6]
# Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @next = _next
#     end
# end
# @param {ListNode} head
# @return {ListNode}
